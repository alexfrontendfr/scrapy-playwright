## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/alexfrontendfr/web-scraper.git
cd web-scraper

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

For Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

For macOS and Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


3. Upgrade pip and install wheel:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install wheel

4. Install the required dependencies:
pip install scrapy==2.5.1 Flask==2.0.1 scrapy-playwright==0.0.14 playwright==1.12.0 scrapy-user-agents==0.1.1 requests==2.26.0 stem==1.8.0

5. Install Playwright browsers:
playwright install

6. Install Tor (for .onion scraping):
- Windows: Download and install the Tor Browser from https://www.torproject.org/download/
- macOS: `brew install tor`
- Linux: `sudo apt install tor`

## Running the Scraper

1. Activate your virtual environment (if it's not already activated).
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run the Flask application: cd scraper_bot/scraper_bot python app.py
4. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
5. Enter your search term, select the search engine, set the result limit, and start scraping!

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any dependency conflicts, try creating a new virtual environment and following the installation steps again.
- Make sure Tor is running if you're trying to scrape .onion sites.
- Check the console output for any error messages if the scraper isn't working as expected.

If you continue to experience issues, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
