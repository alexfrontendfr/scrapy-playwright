Setup Guide for Scrapy Playwright Web Scraper

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the Scrapy Playwright Web Scraper project on your local machine.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

Installation Steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scrapy-playwright.git
   cd scrapy-playwright
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   For Windows:
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   For macOS and Linux:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

3. Upgrade pip and install wheel:
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install wheel

4. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Install Playwright browsers:
   playwright install

6. Install Tor (for .onion scraping):
   - Windows: Download and install the Tor Browser from https://www.torproject.org/download/
   - macOS: `brew install tor`
   - Linux: `sudo apt install tor`

Running the Scraper:

1. Activate your virtual environment (if it's not already activated).
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run the Flask application:
   cd scraper_bot
   python app.py
4. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
5. Enter your search term, select the search engine, set the result limit, and start scraping!

Troubleshooting:

- If you encounter any dependency conflicts, try creating a new virtual environment and following the installation steps again.
- Make sure Tor is running if you're trying to scrape .onion sites.
- Check the console output for any error messages if the scraper isn't working as expected.
