# Setup Guide for Matrix Web Scraper

## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git
- Redis server

## Installation Steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matrix-web-scraper.git
   cd matrix-web-scraper
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```
   playwright install
   ```

5. Install and start Redis:
   - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install redis-server`
   - macOS: `brew install redis`
   - Windows: Download and install from https://redis.io/download

## Running the Application:

1. Start the Redis server (if not already running):
   ```
   redis-server
   ```

2. Start the Celery worker:
   ```
   celery -A scraper_bot.tasks worker --loglevel=info
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python scraper_bot/app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000

## Troubleshooting:

- If you encounter any dependency conflicts, try creating a new virtual environment and following the installation steps again.
- Make sure Redis is running before starting the Celery worker and Flask application.
- Check the console output for any error messages if the scraper isn't working as expected.
- If you're having issues with Tor or proxy connections, ensure that your firewall isn't blocking the necessary ports.
